blueprint:
  name: Candeo C-ZB-RD1P (REM or DPM mode) - Light or Speaker Control via Helper in ZHA
  description: >
    **Dual control for C-ZB-RD1P (Remote Mode or Dual Purpose Mode) using ZHA**

    Use a Candeo RD1P to control either your smart lights or a media speaker from the same knob.

    A helper chooses the active target so presses and rotation do the right thing for lights or audio.

    Single press toggles the current target, double press switches targets, and rotation adjusts brightness or volume.

    
    **Features:**

    - **Single press**: Toggles the active target  
      - 💡 If target is **lights** it toggles the selected light, group, or area  
      - 🔊 If target is **speaker** it plays or pauses the media player

    - **Double press**: Cycles the helper between **lights** and **speaker**

    - **Rotary control:**
      - ➕ Right rotation increases **brightness** or **volume**
      - ➖ Left rotation decreases **brightness** or **volume**

    
    ⚡ **Advanced features:**

    - 🏠 Works with individual lights, groups, or areas

    - 🎚️ Adjustable step sizes for brightness and volume

    - 🔄 Smooth behavior with both **Started rotating** and **Rotating** actions

    - 🧠 Optional notifications to show the active target after switching

    
    **🛠️ Setup Required:**

    Before using this blueprint, create this helper:

    Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers

    "Create Helper" → "Dropdown"

    - Name: "RD1P Active Target"

    - Options: lights, speaker

    
    **How It Works:**

    - **Single Press**: Sends toggle to the target defined by the helper

    - **Double Press**: Updates the helper to the next option and wraps around

    - **Rotate Knob**: Adjusts brightness for lights or volume for speaker using your step sizes

    
    **Requirements:**

    - C-ZB-RD1P device in Remote Mode or Dual Purpose Mode

    - ZHA with device actions available

    - Dimmable lights for brightness control and a media_player that supports volume_level

    
    **Version**: 1.0

    **Compatible Devices**: Candeo C-ZB-RD1P (Remote Mode or Dual Purpose Mode)
